Options for Add Atom Menu:

1. Species Dialog Box. Type what species of the atom you want to add is.

2. Direction Dropdown box. Options are '+' and '-'

3. Distance Dialog Box. Enter in the distance you want inbetween the selected atom and the new atom you are adding

4. Axis dropdown box. Options are 'x','y' or 'z'. This is what axial direction you want to add the new atom in reference to the selected atom.

5. Execute Button. By pressing this button, the atoms will be added by the settings in the menu to every atom that is selected in the editor.
